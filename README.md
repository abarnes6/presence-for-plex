## FAQ

### Why does Presence For Plex show "No active sessions"?

If the application is connecting to your Plex server but not detecting your media playback:

1. Check your Plex server's network settings
2. Go to Plex server Settings â†’ Network
3. Verify that "Preferred network interface" is set correctly
    - If set to "Auto", try selecting your specific network interface instead
    - This is particularly important for servers with multiple network interfaces

### Why do the buttons not work?

They do, but only for others! For some reason Discord doesn't like to show you your own rich presence buttons.

### Could not connect to any Discord socket. Is Discord running?

You need to have a Discord app running in the same machine as the application.

It will try to connect to Discord using the following files:

-   Windows: `\\.pipe\discord-ipc-0` to `discord-ipc-9`
-   macOS: `$TMPDIR/discord-ipc-0` to `discord-ipc-9`
-   Linux:
    - `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/discord-ipc-0` to `discord-ipc-9`
    - `$HOME/.discord-ipc-0` to `discord-ipc-9`
    - `/var/run/$UID/snap.discord/discord-ipc-0`
    - `/var/run/$UID/app/com.discordapp.Discord/discord-ipc-0`

If none of those succeed, it means it can not talk to your Discord local client.
